# Scientific-Computations-on-Mathematica
This is an upgrade programming computations on mathematica like, how to calculate the surface charge density of monopole, dipole and quadruple. This also includes to solving a differential eq. by variation of parameters, shooting method, series approaximation and Lorentz transformation technique.
